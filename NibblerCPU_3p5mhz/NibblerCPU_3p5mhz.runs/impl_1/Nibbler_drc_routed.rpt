LUTLP-1#1 Critical Warning
Combinatorial Loop Alert  
13 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is a/dataOut_reg_1. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: a/aluResult_OBUF[2]_inst_i_9, fetch/aluResult_OBUF[0]_inst_i_1,
fetch/aluResult_OBUF[0]_inst_i_2, fetch/aluResult_OBUF[0]_inst_i_3,

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
60 out of 66 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: aPort[3:0], addressCon[11:0], address[11:0], aluResult[3:0], dataBus[3:0],
ffOut[3:0], flags[1:0], instr[3:0], notLoadA, operand[3:0], phase
programByte[7:0].
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
60 out of 66 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: aPort[3:0], addressCon[11:0], address[11:0], aluResult[3:0], dataBus[3:0],
